  tagline: "<ul>
                <li>Developed PR-Quadtrees to index the space for the in-memory database.</li>
                <li>Placed the pointers of a child quadnode contiguously in a vector collection instead of having one pointer to node like the classic implementation. This made the QuadNode have a smaller memory footprint in the cache and improved data locality.</li>
                <li>Improving data locality resulted in descendants present in the cache increasing the cache hit-cache miss ratio.</li>
                <li>For MXCIF Quadtree, the leaf capacity was made configurable, in order to reduce the fan out on insertion of new data.</li>
                    <li>The approach overall boosted the space usage by approx. 40.</li>
                <li>Technologies: C++.</li>
